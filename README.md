# MOVIE SAGAS

## Description

_Duration: Weekend Challenge_

This app displays movie data from a database. A list is presented to the user on the home screen displaying the movie's poster, title and description. Clicking a movie poster navigates a user to the movie's detail view which also displays that movie's genres. From the details view, users can navigate to 2 places, back to the list or to the edit view. The edit view allows a user to change a movie's title or description.
